            <p><strong>How and Why We Started?</strong></p>

Indian Railways is the preferred<br></br> transportation mode for a vast majority of Indian population, yet pertinent information is not readily available and<br></br> the information rather available is scattered. It is then, RailYatri stepped in to tackle such worries of its railway<br></br> passengers. It has always aimed to be the capable train travel advisor helping passengers make informed decisions.</p>
            <p>We, at RailYatri do not just stop at presenting the dry numbers, but provide insights behind them. We offer analytical <br></br>based information that makes us standout alone of the other sources of information. This is why our users’ base has<br></br> been growing with every passing day.</p>
